# Wsprry Pi

Wsprry Pi is a Raspberry Pi-based transmitter for amateur radio operators who want to explore propagation with WSPR. The project focuses on making a low-cost, low-complexity beacon practical to install, configure, and operate on common Raspberry Pi hardware.

Wsprry Pi supports two distinct transmitter paths. The Si5351 clock-generator
backend is the supported path for 2 m. Direct Raspberry Pi GPIO has been
qualified on 80 m, 20 m, 15 m, and 10 m with production pacing. WsprryPi
rejects direct GPIO requests in the 12 m, 6 m, and 2 m band ranges before
transmitter activation. See
[GPIO Band Capabilities and Signal Quality](FAQ/why_12m_looks_noisy.md) before
choosing hardware for a band.

As of version 3.0.0, several CW capabilities were added to the suite:

- QRSS: The name “QRSS” is a derivation of the Q code “QRS”, a phrase Morse code operators send to indicate the transmitter needs to slow down. The extra “S” means slow way, way down.
- FSKCW: Frequency Shift Keying CW is a variant of QRSS. Instead of switching the carrier on and off, FSKCW keeps it active for the transmission and shifts the frequency downward during gaps between elements and characters.
- DFCW: Dual Frequency CW is a combination of QRSS and FSKCW. In DFCW, the element duration is replaced by the element frequency, speeding transmissions considerably.

To configure these modes, see [Configure WSPR and CW](User_Interface/Setup/Signal_Setup/index.md). For their direct command-line controls, see [CW Mode Options](Command_Line_Operations/cw_modes.md). [Scott Harden's AJ4VD website](https://swharden.com/blog/tags/#qrss) provides additional QRSS background and experiments.

This documentation is organized to help you move through the project in a practical order:

- Learn what WSPR is and how Wsprry Pi works.
- Install the software and required supporting services.
- Configure and operate the system through the web UI or command line.
- Use the reference and FAQ material when you need detail or troubleshooting.
