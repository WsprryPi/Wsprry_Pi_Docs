# Configuration Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting CW Configuration Saves

When a QRSS, FSKCW, or DFCW message would take longer than its configured repeat interval, Setup marks the Message field invalid and displays **Save failed** with the calculated duration and repeat interval. The invalid draft remains in the browser so it can be corrected, but it is not applied to the running configuration. Autosave resumes automatically when the adjusted duration is less than or equal to the repeat interval.

This inline state identifies a timing problem that can be corrected on the Setup page. Other configuration reload failures that cannot be tied safely to an editable field may still appear in the general reload-failure dialog and may require checking the application log or configuration file.

See {ref}`cw-message-too-long` for the duration inputs and correction steps.
